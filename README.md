Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room is a game developer that wishes to create a web-based game where teams guess what an image is as it generates from nothing to the full image over time. They are working on such a title called Draw It or Lost It. They wanted the game to consist of rounds where each team is assigned an image that generates over thirty seconds in a one minute round. The opposing teams would get a chance to guess the image if the assigned team did not guess it correctly in the time allotted.
  The Gaming Room specifically requested these capabilities as software requirements:
    - Each game instance to consist of one or more teams.
    - Each team to consist of one or more players.
    - Each game instance to be uniquely named and all teams within a game to be as such as well.
    - Each user to be able to get feedback whether a game name, team name, or user name is in use.
    - Each game instance can only exist as one singular instance in memory at a time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  Discerning software requirements from the input from The Gaming Room was an extremely important thing to do. Therefore, I made sure I put extra effort in to discern the wants and needs of the client. For where I am in my Computer Science career, I explained the UML model to the best of my ability. Even if I do not know exactly how to code an entire program that should behave in accordance with this model, I do have the ability to interpret and explain what it should do.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  The design document gives you the big picture of how the program is supposed to interact with entities within itself and behave as an overall function for the end user. When I was working through making the entities of the design document UML that we were to work with, I found myself referring to it often to ensure I gave the entities the reuqire capabilities. The flow of the UML also helped me to remember how the classes interact with one another which the provides the guidance on how to program they interact with one another.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  The Evaluation portion of my document is not a strong point of my knowledge. In this portion, I was required to differentiate the various common operating platforms and discern how they would stack up in terms in viability of server side and client side program development and implementation. I have exlusive knowledge of Windows based systems and limited coding experience. From what I learned throughout the course I have gathered that the three major platforms, and even mobile devices, can easily allow cross platform developing and can easily implement software that would run on any of them as well. That was not always true, but the development of versatile languages and more inclusive development software in recent times allows for such a capability. I would definitely revise this portion of the document in the future when I have gained personal experience and more advanced knowledge of these platforms and how they affect the software development process.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The user's needs have to be fully understood in terms of the program at hand and what they are supposed to be getting out of the program. In terms of Draw It or Lose It, the client defined several software requirements to implement into the game. The main idea was to create unique names for game instances, teams, and palyers. Therefore, the end user should be able to type in any name and get feedback whether that name exists or not so they can know to choose a new one. The program is a game, therefore some sort of chat would be necessary to communicate with team mates or friends. A lobby system to find games could be useful. There are so many things that a user could want or need to translate to a better experience, and all a developer needs to do is imagine they are the user and think about what they would expect from the program.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I analyzed the UML diagram to make sure I had full understanding of how data was to flow between the classes of the game. Working through the code via the FIXME portions one at a time prevents me from creating problems for myself in various portions of the code and keeps me focused on the task at hand. If I did not know what a specific portion of the code that was present when I took over did or was supposed to do, I would look up the documentation for the class, function, etc. I would learn that certain functions need certain inputs or a plethora or other random things that I would have never known without checking the language documentation. That is a useful skill to have as sometimes you need to check the documentation, or ask a fellow developer on your team. Communication can help immensely when working in a group as everyone can teach one another and share to expand their team member's knowledge of a language and strengthen their programming abilities in the process.
